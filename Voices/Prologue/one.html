    <h1>Voice?</h1>
    <p>Voice. My voice creates reality. Without reality, there is dissonance. I keep peace on this planet and I have, in my whole life kept it hidden to everyone else. But I was always known. Known for my voice that could show barrier between truth and fake. <br><br>

        I've protected this my whole life, only for me to be betrayed by my only dear universe. I've seen darkness corrupt my planet, and I'm seeing it corrupt my voice. But I won't let it happen.<br><br>
        
        As soon as this corruption crawls deep in my heart, I must break this voice before it turns reality to dissonance.

    <h1>Voice Shards?</h1>
    <p>The voice shards do not exist until now. As soon as I break my voice into pieces, it will replicate shards that will create reality as a whole. For now, I create reality, but with them, they create the elements of existence and I exist no further than that.<br><br>

        As soon as this corruption crawls deep in my heart, I must break this voice before it turns reality to dissonance. And I can already feel it.<br><br>
        
        Please, protect my voice.<br><br>

        Not long after that, a crack deafens the character and a light blinds the whole universe. Unconsciously, the Goddess vanished and only one shard shined brightly before descending onto the planet. A whisper echoes into the air, before the sky dims orange, a tint of a sunset.<br><br>

        <i>Courage.</i>

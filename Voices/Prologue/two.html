    <h1>Corruption?</h1>
    <p>No one is made to be corrupted. Only those who felt caged in the world and are seeking for something more are corrupted. Those who never felt comfort amongst themselves are mare corrupted. Those who believed that they could change the world with their own deeds are corrupted.<br><br>

        By owning the voices that makes the world alive and well, they could turn all light into darkness. And if all voices are corrupted by the corruption, everyone will live in manipulation.<br><br>
        
        Do not be serenaded by the corruption and their harmonic voices. Those voices are caged and was never meant for them.<br><br>
        
        As soon as this corruption crawls deep in my heart, I must break this voice before it turns reality to dissonance.

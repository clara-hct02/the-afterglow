    <h1>PROLOGUE</h1>
    <p>My world has been corrupted, but they'll never take me.<br></br>

        I command this world to live by itself, with my voice to be protected by its lone protectors. In every voice shards shattered may give life to the universe I loved living in, creating all elements a world must possess.<br></br>
        
        And if one of my dear protectors betray and corrupt the voice shard given to them, must be punished in accordance to the rule of the sailor guardians, LYLAS, whose sole role is to save my protectors from the corruption.<br></br>
        
        As soon as this corruption crawls deep in my heart, I must break this voice before it turns reality to dissonance. <br></br>
        
        <b><i>Please, protect my voice.</i></b>
